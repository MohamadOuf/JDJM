<h1>Introduction to Virtual Reality</h1>
    
    Virtual reality (VR) refers to a computer-generated simulation in which a person can interact within an artificial three-dimensional environment using electronic devices, such as special goggles with a screen or gloves fitted with sensors. In this simulated artificial environment, the user is able to have a realistic-feeling experience.

<h2>VR(Virtual Reality)</h2>
    
    Our brain relies on sensory cues and memories to understand the world. This happens quickly. A view from a mountain top and a steep slope below our feet reminds us of being up high. It’s enough to convince our brains that we’re there—struggling to keep our balance!
VR takes advantage of these brain shortcuts to alter our perception of what’s real.

  <h2>Current events on VR</h2>
    /*
    <p> There are many currents that are happening around Virtual Reality, especially since COVID-19 has help accelerate its progress. Since COVID has happened some hospitals have consider the idea of remote health appointments.
        Research from the University of Kent, the Research centre on Interactive Media, Smart systems and Emerging technologies --RISE Ltd
        and the University of Cyprus has revealed that Virtual Reality technology can have significant impact on the credibility
        of remote health appointments with patients that has eating disorder with the processed called
        Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy or VRET. What's interesting about the process is that they would let the patient use the VR headset
        and create their virtual avatar and customize it to their own physical body. With this process the patient and thearpist would enter
        a virtual space and the therapist would examine each part of their body and perform adjustments while the patient will describe
        their feelings, thoughts and concern with the therapist. What's nice about this since they are in a cartoon-like avatar the patient
        will have the lack of fear of judgement during the session. Without the judgement the patient will be more honest about what they think about
        their body which can help give a more accurate thearpy session.</p>

    <p> (EDIT) Another current event that is happening in Virtual Reality is that there is a new virtual reality software that allows scientist to "walk" inside
        cells. With this software this helps the researchs go inside and analyse individual cells, this could be used to understand fundamental problems
        in biology and help develop new treatment for diseases. The software is called vLUME, it was created by scientists at the University of Cambridge
        and 3D image analysis software company Lume VR Ltd.
