<h1>Introduction to Virtual Reality</h1>
    /*
    Virtual reality (VR) refers to a computer-generated simulation in which a person can interact within an artificial three-dimensional environment using electronic devices, such as special goggles with a screen or gloves fitted with sensors. In this simulated artificial environment, the user is able to have a realistic-feeling experience.

<h2>VR(Virtual Reality)</h2>
    /*
    Our brain relies on sensory cues and memories to understand the world. This happens quickly. A view from a mountain top and a steep slope below our feet reminds us of being up high. It’s enough to convince our brains that we’re there—struggling to keep our balance!
VR takes advantage of these brain shortcuts to alter our perception of what’s real.
