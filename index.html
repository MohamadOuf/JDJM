<h1>Introduction to Virtual Reality</h1>
    
    Virtual reality (VR) refers to a computer-generated simulation in which a person can interact within an artificial three-dimensional environment using electronic devices, such as special goggles with a screen or gloves fitted with sensors. In this simulated artificial environment, the user is able to have a realistic-feeling experience.

<h2>VR(Virtual Reality)</h2>
    
    Our brain relies on sensory cues and memories to understand the world. This happens quickly. A view from a mountain top and a steep slope below our feet reminds us of being up high. It’s enough to convince our brains that we’re there—struggling to keep our balance!
VR takes advantage of these brain shortcuts to alter our perception of what’s real.

    /*
    <p> There are many currents that are happening around Virtual Reality, especially since COVID-19 has help accelerate its progress. Since COVID has happened some hospitals have consider the idea of remote health appointments.
        Research from the University of Kent, the Research centre on Interactive Media, Smart systems and Emerging technologies --RISE Ltd
        and the University of Cyprus has revealed that Virtual Reality technology can have significant impact on the credibility
        of remote health appointments with patients that has eating disorder with the processed called
        Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy or VRET. What's interesting about the process is that they would let the patient use the VR headset
        and create their virtual avatar and customize it to their own physical body. With this process the patient and thearpist would enter
        a virtual space and the therapist would examine each part of their body and perform adjustments while the patient will describe
        their feelings, thoughts and concern with the therapist. What's nice about this since they are in a cartoon-like avatar the patient
        will have the lack of fear of judgement during the session. Without the judgement the patient will be more honest about what they think about
        their body which can help give a more accurate thearpy session.</p>

    <p> (EDIT) Another current event that is happening in Virtual Reality is that there is a new virtual reality software that allows scientist to "walk" inside
        cells. With this software this helps the researchs go inside and analyse individual cells, this could be used to understand fundamental problems
        in biology and help develop new treatment for diseases. The software is called vLUME, it was created by scientists at the University of Cambridge
        and 3D image analysis software company Lume VR Ltd.

<h2>Potential future VR technology</h2>
    /*
    Virtual Reality is one of the technologies with the highest projected potential for growth. According to the latest forecasts from IDC Research (2018), investment in VR and AR will multiply 21-fold over the next four years, reaching 15.5 billion euros by 2022. In addition, both technologies will be key to companies' digital transformation plans and their spending in this area will exceed that of the consumer sector by 2019. It is, therefore expected that by 2020 over half of the larger European companies will have a VR and RA strategy.

        and 3D image analysis software company Lume VR Ltd. This allows High Definition microscopy data to be both visualised and analysed in a virtual space.
        With this technology it can be used to study everything from a single protein to the entire cell as a whole. With super-resolution it makes it possible
        to obtain images at the nanoscale using tools of physics to get arund the limits imposed by light diffraction. With these tools this has allowed researchers to
        observe molecular processes as they happen. The only problem is the lack of ways to visualise and analyse it in three dimensions. </p>
